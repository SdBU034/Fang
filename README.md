# Scrapy X fang.com

**At first,You need to do the following:**  

* Ensure you have installed python3 and scrapy and some needed packages such as pymysql in your computer.
* You should be familiar to Python.
* You have installed git and can use it correctly. 

**Then,execute following command in terminal to clone this repository to your computer.**

> ```
> git clone https://github.com/SdBU034/Fang.git
> ```

**At this time,you can use `cd Fang` in terminal to enter the path of this project.**

**Then,execute following command in terminal to run the spider.**

> ```
> scrapy crawl fang
> ```

1. In this command line,`crawl` means to **start-up** this spider,and `fang` is the spider's name.which is the **unique identification** of one spider.

2. If it works correctly, you can see the datas which we want to get will appear fastly.If you just run it for testing,you can use `Ctrl` +`C` to interrupt it.

**I'll submit the introduction about this project again in a while.**
